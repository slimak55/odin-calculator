# The Odin Project

## Project Calculator

This is my take on the project Calculator from The Odin Project. This was easier than I thought. I had few problems solving how to get the number to the variables from a numpad. but after that I snowballed it and it went pretty well after that. My code could be improved, and I know that there is a better way to do it, but it works hopefully how it is intended.
